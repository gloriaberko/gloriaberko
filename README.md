Hello.

If you do not who I am my name is Gloria Berko but I normally go by Berko on the internet, I have been learning and actively developing for the LUA/gLUA language for a while now, but I am still learning and innovating with my projects on the coding language.

I also do mapping/level creation for the Source Engine, I've been doing it for a while now, for about 1-2 years I think but I am pretty good at it overall in my own opinion. Although I am starting to map for the Source 2 Engine, I still have a lot of things to learn about it.
